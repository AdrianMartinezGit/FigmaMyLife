            in the United States, currently attending a trade school in the city of Stockon,
            called Codestack Academy.

            I was born on the 7th of January of 2005, in the city of Walnut Creek, raised by my Mom and Dad, who
            were originally from Mexico but moved to the U.S., along with my brother, who was born in the U.S. 
            and was more older than me. I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and therefore, was put
            in a special program. Eventually I was taken out of the program and instead enrolled in the Antioch Unified School District (AUSD) System.
            <br><br>
            Growing up, I’ve faced many challenges and obstacles, both at home, and at school, but despite my disability, I was able to work hard and 
            excel through the hardships, going from the beginning of Pre-K, to the end of High School where I got to see myself and many others graduate 
            from the AUSD School System, marking another chapter in my Life. I’m now preparing myself to live independently, having gotten my own Driver’s 
            License and Payment Card, and learning how to live by myself.
